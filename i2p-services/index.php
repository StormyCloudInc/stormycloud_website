      We operate a highly available and redundant I2P reseed server. I2P is a peer-to-peer network that employs "Garlic Routing" to ensure privacy. Reseed nodes are essential for connecting to I2P for the first time, and while you may only need them occasionally, they play a crucial role in maintaining a secure and reliable network.

  Accessing the I2P IRC network usually requires an active I2P router deployment. However, we are pleased to offer a public I2P IRC server that anyone can connect to. This allows users to chat with others on the I2P network easily, fostering communication and community engagement.
